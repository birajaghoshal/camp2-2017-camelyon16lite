# CAMP II Summer Seminar 2017 - Digital Pathology Exercise

An introduction to convolutional neural networks using Tensorflow and and a ridiculously down-sampled version of the Camelyon16 training data set in python.

## Getting Started

1. Check out or download this repository.
2. Download the image data from https://app.box.com/s/59hhimjpxzl04kjqqlmxpdohs9kth753. It's a 154MB 7z file with the training and testing images. 
3. Make sure all of the prerequisite python packages are installed.
4. Change the path in the script (cnn_simple.py) to the directory with the unzipped image files.
5. Run the script in python (cnn_simple.py).

### Prerequisites

*Python
*Tensorflow
*Numpy
*Scipy
*Pillow
